# Pre Week

## MetaAI Prompting

During the promting video with Meta AI I focused on building my application for the German language as its one I personally want to learn.

## ChatGPT Prompting

When asking ChatGPT 4 Turbo to improve my prompts I decided to ask it normally, then to ask it with the `Reason` feautre turned on. The reasoning took about 8 seconds but the result was really good, and better than the first response. I ended up using this Reasoned response to update my prompt.

### Extra Notes and Activities

- I was able to use AI (Chat GPT) to understand some of the hardest issues English speakers have with German and added that into my prompt for the MetaAI Assistant. Telling the AI to focus on these issues.

- Learnt from Andrew that we can do some simple investigating to find out what model is being used on a platform by just asking it lol. Using this I was able to know that the Free Teir ChatGPT was running GPT 4 turbo.
