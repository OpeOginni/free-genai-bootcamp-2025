## Prompting Experience

- The Reason feature works a lot well when you want the model to take in a lot of information and for it to absorb it and then return it in a better and more concice format. I tested this by asking the model to make my prompt better without the reasoning and with the reasoning, the result gotten with reasoning was by far the better one.
